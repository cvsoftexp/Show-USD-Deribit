Add the USD value to the output of the BTC Value column on default UI on Deribit.
Will possibly update to the pro UI when out of beta. 

To use:
* Navigate to chrome://extensions
* Expand the Developer dropdown menu and click “Load Unpacked Extension”
* Navigate to the local folder containing the extension’s code and click Ok
* Assuming there are no errors, the extension should load into your browser

Got the idea from: https://github.com/gizmobin/Bittrex-BTCtoUSD. Thx Robin!
